# Hostel-Managment-System

Hostel Management SystemProject Statement:

Hostel management system offers a full featured accommodation system to efficiently manage
the entire residential facility in the university of college. Reducing the staff & paper works, this
accommodation software will keep the updated records of students, their meal, lodging, transfer
room and other facilities. The software allocates rooms to the registered students based on their
preferences and records their details of using food, lodging and other facilities along with fee and
other advance payment details. The system also gathers a feedback on the room, food and other
amenities on a regular basis and sends fee reminders to all registered students. This hostel
management system monitors attendance, disciplinary logs, room charge status and check-in
check-out in hostel premises.
